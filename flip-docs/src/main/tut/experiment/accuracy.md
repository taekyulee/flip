# Accuracy on Data Streams

`Sketch` of *Flip* estimates density from data stream under various conditions. When the data follows stationary statistical properties such as normal, bimodal, log-normal, and pareto, it can be reasonably estimated. Even if the concept drift that is varying statistical properties of the data stream occurs suddenly or incrementally, `Sketch` can successfully estimate the probability density. 


## Standard normal distribution

## Bimodal distribution consisting of two standard normal distributions

Here is a result for a bimodal probabability density function consisting of two standard normal distributions centered at -2 and 2.

## Incremental concept drift

Here is a experiment result under the situation where the distribution that `Sketch` should estimate is incrementally changing over time. The underlying distribution starts to change when the update count is 300 and moves by +0.01 per update count. Sketch is predicting this moving distribution well including some lag.

This figure shows the estimated median and KL-divergence by using `Sketch`.


## Sudden concept drift

Here is a experiment result under the situation where the distribution that `Sketch` should estimate is changing suddenly. When the update count is 300, the underlying standard normal distribution suddenly moves its center to the point at 5.

## `flatMap`

If you choose a first order function `A â‡’ Kernel` from value `A` to kernel function `Kernel` centered on the given value `A` as a parameter of `flatMap`, this operation is a probability distribution smoothing method, often called kernel density estimation, or KDE for short. 

The following figure shows the result of implementing KDE as a simple example of `flatMap`. At first, log-normal distribution is estimated by `Sketch`. Then, KDE with normal distribution with deviation 1.5 as kernel function executes.

## `map`

The following figure is the result of an experiment that estimates the standard normal distribution using `Sketch` and then transform the domain to the log-normal distribution using the `map` operation. 

By definition, the [log-normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution#Characterization) is a distribution that takes the log of domain X for a normal distribution. Therefore, if `Sketch` which is learned by normal distribution executes `map` operation, that is `stdSketch.map(x => math.exp(x))`, the log-normal distribution should be obtained as a result.
